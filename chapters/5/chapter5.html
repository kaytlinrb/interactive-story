            <p id='chapterFourStory'>Exhausted but determined, you make your way up the mountain. Sweat pools on your brow as the sun beats down on you. You start to lose your balance and catch yourself, but not without rolling your ankle. The drop of your weight pries your grip from the rocks and you tumble down the side of the mountain. Sharp rocks tear like teeth into your clothes and skin. Finally you hit a level landing and come rolling to a halt. Badly cut and bruised, you don’t find yourself being able to move at all. You hear the high pitched echo of a little girl bouncing off the mountains. You think it sounds far away but then you hear the laugh again, right behind you, “Silly!” She mocks you in a playful tone. It hurts to move so you can only tilt your head to examine her. She appears to be a young girl of 12 years but she has the mark of a witch on her ankle. A band of indecipherable ancient magic words that look branded into her skin. “Humans are funny. So clumsy!” She twirls and another fit of giggles spills out of her. “Please” you groan. “If there’s any way you could help me?” She steps in front of you and gingerly taps her finger on her chin. “Will you play a game with me?” She grins impishly.</p>

Against the hateful thieves who ravage the stores of grain, I ambush, I silently set a snare of death. A roaming huntress, I invade the lairs of wild beasts, But I do not wish to chase fleeing herds alongside dogs.'</p>
