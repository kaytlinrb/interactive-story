          <p id='chapterOneStory'>You find yourself wandering through the dense forest. You don't remember how you got here or where you are, but for some reason you feel compelled to follow the sun toward a tall rock formation. You climb atop and spot a wheathered old man on the other side. He is stooping to gather a drink from the glistening blue stream that carves through the forrest. His rags look as old as time and he is clearly struggling to gather the water in his hands. He sees you looking at him and narrows his eyes. "Whitless Boy!" he beckons you. "Would you answer my Riddle?"</p>
