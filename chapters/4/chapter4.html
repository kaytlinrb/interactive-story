              <p id='chapterSixStory'>You’ve spent two fortnights under the employ of Ghrom, master of steel. He is a mystery to you now more than ever. His communication with you is limited almost exclusively to letters left to you that mostly consist of lists of tasks to accomplish and a series of grunts and growls. You appreciate his generosity in giving you a position and you respect his quiet wisdom. Most days you spend forging simple horse shoes and cheap iron swords according to Ghrom’s prewritten specifications. Other than the grueling work, you’ve fallen in love with the town. Though modest, the population is generous and kindhearted. You have secured close friendships and have started to work your way into the tight-knit community. </p>
              <p>Presently, you are working after your expected hours late into the night. You hope to one day hone you skills in order to produce swords and armor comparable to the artistry of your master. Sitting with your notes, you realize how limited your teachings have been. If you ever hope to master your new trade, you need any additional material you can find. Determined and driven by your frustration you decide that you are no longer content forging only the simplest items. You need more resources. Your eyes dart to your master’s private desk hidden away in the corner of the room. You have only seen him use it once, but it is the only place you have not already searched. You slink over to it, hopes rising. You see that the lock has not been fully fastened. Using a pointed chisel and narrow tongs, you manipulate the fastener to try and unlatch it.</p>

              <p id='chapterSixStory'> You hear a click and carefully open the desk, checking incessantly for anyone around you. Nothing is in the desk but a stack of yellowed papers. From the bottom of the stack you see peeking out a beautiful diagram of an intricate breastplate. You squirrel away the stack into your blacksmith’s apron and dart back to your own secluded work area to examine the papers.You set aside the breastplate diagram to work on first. Then, shuffling through the papers, you notice something odd. Besides a few valuable blueprints for armor, the rest of the papers are details and diagrams of a purple gem inside the heart of a tree. There is also incriminating record of correspondence of a cult following a firey deamon. Your master seems to be a figurehead of a group called the Zchok Arran. You see detailed plans to acquire the gem from a nearby mountain and harness its magical properties to resurrect their demon leader. You’re confused. Nothing up to this point has led you to suspect Ghrom of any kind of treachery but to save the village you must act fast. You grab one of your dull swords, as many provisions as you can carry, and return all the papers carefully back into your masters’ desk excepting the map, making sure to leave it partially locked just as you had found it and set off on your journey</p>
