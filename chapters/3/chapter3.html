            <p id='chapterThreeStory'>You see the outline of an empty town in the distance. Joy fills your belly as you picture a cozy bed and a warm meal awaiting you at the first inn you see. You bound across the plane, trying to close the distance as soon as possible. Your stomach is aching with hunger and you pay hardly any attention the buildings as you pass them. You scan for a sign. The first one you see has a carving of a snarling wolf head. “The Wolves’ Den”. You think nothing of it as you stumble over the threshold in your desperation to acquire food. “Whatever’s in the pot, a bed, and a pint!” you project to the inkeeper. There are only two other men sitting down at a nearby table. One turns toward you and glares. The other has a friendly face and a wide toothy smile. “Care for a game of Gwent?” You sit, but avert your eyes. “I’ve lost my deck to bandits years ago. Never bothered to replace the deck.” “Tragic story, that” the toothy man sympathized. “Here” he slides over a deck of cards. “Been awhile since I’ve met any challenge. Play a game!” “I’ve not got much coin to spare” you say. “We’ll figure something out. Ghrom.” The man nudged the other “I think I’ve found you a new assistant. Your position’s been open for an age!” “I stand to win coin or trade” you shrug. “First prove your wit” grizzled Ghrom “then we shall talk.”</p>
