            <p id='riddle2SuccessTxt'>The troll makes a sound somewhere between a screech and a wretch of disgust. 'Magic! Human! How do you know this? Troll Henry told troll Dura puzzle. Dura not know. Dura ask human, human know!' You shrug. The troll shoves its muddy finger in your face and yells 'Dura be back. Dura tell Henry. Henry thinks he smart but Dura smarter. Dura be back, solve other puzzle. Dura beat all Henry puzzle!' The troll mutters to itself as it walks back through the bog. You think the troll meant for you to stay, but you decided it might be better to bail while you have the chance. You scurry back to the dirt road and continue on you way.</p>
